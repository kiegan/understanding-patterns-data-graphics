An abstract is a single paragraph that summarizes the significant aspects of the manuscript. Often it indicates whether the manuscript is a report of new work, a review or overview, or a combination thereof. Do not cite references in the abstract. Papers must not have been published previously and must be targeted toward the general technical reader. Papers submitted for peer review (not departments or columns) may fit into the theme of an open Call for Papers or be submitted as a ``Regular'' paper. Some Computer Society (CS) magazines provide early access to full manuscript submissions by posting a preprint of the article prior to its inclusion in an issue. Preprint articles are considered published and may be cited using their Digital Object Identifier (DOI). IEEE's Publishing Operations team will provide editorial and production services throughout the publication process.
